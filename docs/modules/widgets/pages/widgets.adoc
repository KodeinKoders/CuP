= Widget: Compose Material

This section exposes custom UI widgets we've already developed, so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

When using Compose, you are probably using Material to handle your theme.
The downside is that there are two material libraries.

- Material (2): `compose.material`
- Material 3: `compose.material3`

[[install]]
== Installing

[tabs]
====
CuP Plugin::
+
.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin]
----
kotlin {
    sourceSets.commonMain.dependencies {
        implementation(cup.widgets.material)
        // or implementation(cup.widgets.material3)
    }
}
----

Regular Gradle::
+
.build.gradle.kts
[source, kotlin, subs="attributes"]
----
kotlin {
    sourceSets.commonMain.dependencies {
        implementation("net.kodein.cup:cup-widgets-material:{version}")
        // or implementation("net.kodein.cup:cup-widgets-material3:{version}")
    }
}
----

[CAUTION]
====
Beware that APIs are very much the same, they only differ from their packages, which are:
- `net.kodein.cup.widgets.material`
- `net.kodein.cup.widgets.material3`

[[bullet-points]]
== Bullet points

Bullet points are a standard way of presenting a list of items in presentations.
CuP provides a `BulletPoints` composable function that animates each item as it appears:

[source, kotlin]
----
BulletPoints {
    BulletPoint(visible = step >= 1) {
        Text("The first item.")
    }
    BulletPoint(visible = step >= 2) {
        Text("The second item.")
    }
}
----

[[typography]]
== Typography downsizing

As CuP modifies the density to adapt the content of your slides to the presentation screen, the default Material typographies are not adapted to a "scaled up" content and would present big texts (such as `h1` or `displayLarge`) way too large when scaled for your presentation.

To avoid this, CuP provides the `cupScaleDown` helper function (for both Material libraries) which properly scales your typography to be adapted to a CuP presentation.

[source, kotlin]
----

MaterialTheme(
    typography = MaterialTheme.typography.cupScaleDown() //<1>
) {
    // ...
}
----
<1> Scales down the typography to adapt it to CuP.
