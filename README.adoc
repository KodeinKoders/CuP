[.lead]
A pure Kotlin Compose Multiplatform presentation system for developer presenters.

== Get Started

=== https://kodeinkoders.github.io/CuP[Documentation]

=== https://github.com/KodeinKoders/CuP-Presentation-Template/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file[Presentation project template]

=== https://slack-chats.kotlinlang.org/c/cup-presentations[Join the community on the #cup-presentations Slack channel!]

== Beta

During the time CuP is offered in Beta, the following statements are true:

* When API changes:
** Old API raises depreciation errors (we do not use depreciation warnings) for at least one version (we aim for two when possible).
** We provide a migration path as much as possible (either in the depreciation error message or in the release notes).
* We do *not* ensure binary compatibility between versions, and try to fail early with understandable exceptions (when possible), for at lease one version (we aim for two when possible).

Of course, once we promote CuP to stable, we will provide binary compatibility between minor versions, and full migration cycles between major versions.

== Cool presentation examples

* Stay tuned!

IMPORTANT: If you created a cool presentation with CuP, contact me (`@salomonbrys`) on the https://slack-chats.kotlinlang.org:[Kotlin Slack], and I'll add your presentation to the list!
